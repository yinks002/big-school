### Option 1: Payments & Subscriptions (The Money 💰)
* **Goal:** Restrict some content (e.g., "Premium Videos" or "CBT Exams") so only paid users can access them.
* **Tech:** Integrate **Paystack** (since this is Nigerian-focused).
* **Flow:** Student clicks a locked lesson $\rightarrow$ Paystack Popup $\rightarrow$ Payment Success $\rightarrow$ Content Unlocks.

### Option 2: The Parent Dashboard 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
* **Goal:** Allow parents to monitor their child.
* **Tech:** Link a Parent account to a Student account.
* **Flow:** Parent logs in $\rightarrow$ Enters Child's Email $\rightarrow$ Sees "Performance Report" (Graphs, Quiz Scores, Attendance).

### Option 3: Live Classes 📹
* **Goal:** A schedule for Zoom/Google Meet lessons.
* **Tech:** A "Timetable" feature.
* **Flow:** Admin posts "Maths Live Class - 4 PM" with a Zoom link. Student sees it on their dashboard and clicks "Join".

### Option 4: Deployment (APK) 📲
* **Goal:** Get this off the simulator and onto a real Android phone.
* **Tech:** EA (Expo Application Services).

**My Recommendation:**
If this is for a demo/pilot, **Option 1 (Payments)** or **Option 3 (Live Classes)** will impress stakeholders the most.
